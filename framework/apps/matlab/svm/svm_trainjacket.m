% trainMatrix is now a (numTrainDocs x numTokens) matrix.
% Each row represents a unique document (email).
% The j-th column of the row $i$ represents the number of times the j-th
% token appeared in email $i$. 

% tokenlist is a long string containing the list of all tokens (words).
% These tokens are easily known by position in the file TOKENS_LIST

% trainCategory is a (numTrainDocs x 1) vector containing the true 
% classifications for the documents just read in. The i-th entry gives the 
% correct class for the i-th email (which corresponds to the i-th row in 
% the document word matrix).

% Spam documents are indicated as class 1, and non-spam as class 0.
% Note that for the SVM, you would want to convert these to +1 and -1.
